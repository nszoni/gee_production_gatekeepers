# Gee, stop building into production!

This repository contains artifacts presented at the MDS Fest 2023 community-led virtual conference. The focus of this project is to demonstrate how to implement production gatekeepers in dbt for Snowflake and BigQuery.

## Overview

Production gatekeepers are an important part of any data pipeline. They help ensure that only high-quality data is allowed to flow into production systems. In this project, we demonstrate how to implement production gatekeepers in dbt for Snowflake and BigQuery.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip
- dbt_core, dbt-bigquery, dbt-snowflake
- Snowflake or BigQuery account

Once you have these installed, you can clone this repository and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file in the `snowflake` or `bigquery` directory to set up your environment and run the dbt project.
